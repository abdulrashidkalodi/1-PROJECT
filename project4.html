    <p>Coffee beans are the seed of fruit called a coffee cherry. Aoffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus if
        plants called coffea.There are a wide verityof species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.</p>
    <li><b>Type of bean:</b>thre are two main type of coffee species, Arabica and Robesta. Arabica originate from
        Ethiopia and produces a mild, flaverful tasting coffee. It's the most populer type world wide . how ever, it's
        expencove to grow becouse the arabic plant is sensitive to the enviorlment, requring shade ,humidity and stady
        temperature between 60-75 degree fahrenheut. The Robests coffee plant is more economical to grow becouse it is
        resist to desise and servives in awider range of temperature between 65-97 degree fahrenhit. It can also
        withstand harse climate changes such as variation in rainfall and strong sunlight</li>
    <li><b>Type of Rost:</b>coffie beans start out green.They are rosted at a high heat to produce a chemical change
        that relise the rice aroma and flavour that we assosiate with coffiee.They are then cooled and ground for
        brewing. Rosting levels ringe from light to medium to dark. The lighter to roadt,the lighter the colour and
        rosted flavour and the higher its acidity. dark rosted produce a vlack beans with little acidity and a bitter
        rosted flavour. The populer french rost is medium-dark</li>
    <li><b>Type of grind:</b>A medium grind is the most commen and used used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine
        grind is used for deeper flavour like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee
        presses</li>
    <li><b>Decaffeinated coffee:</b>This is an option for those whoexperiance unpleasant side effects from coffeine.The
        two most commen methode used to remove coffine from coffiee to apply chemical solvents(metholine cloride or
        ethyl acetate)or carben deoxide gas. both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry
        . The solvent bind to coffine and both avoporate when the beans are rainsed and /or dried. According to U.S
        regulation, at least 95% of the cppffine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated lable, so thre may be trace
        residual amounts of caffine.Both methode may couse some loss of flavour as other naturally occurring chemicals
        in coffee beans that impart their unique flavour and scent may be disroyed during processing. </li>
